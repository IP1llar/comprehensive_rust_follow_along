    // data you want to push to the string
    // `String::len` returns the size of the `String` in bytes (which can be different from its
    // length in characters)

// When people refer to strings they could either be talking about`&str` or `String`
// When a type implements `Deref<Target = T>`, the compiler will let you transparently call methods
// from `T`
// - We haven't discussed the `Deref` trait yet
// - `String` implements `Deref<Target = str>` which transparently gives it access to `str`'s
// methods
//
// `String` is implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes, many of the operations you see
// supported on vectors are also supported on `String`, but with some extra guarentees
//
// Compare the different ways to index a `String`:
// - To a character by using `s3.chars().nth(u).unwrap()` where `i` is in-bound, out-of-bounds
// - To a substring by using `s3[0..4]`, where that slice is on character boundaries or not
